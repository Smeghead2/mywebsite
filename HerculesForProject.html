  <p style="color:rgb(60, 50, 90)"> Icarus and his uncle Daedulus were inventors who were locked in a tower by the king. Daedulus and Icarus spent their time building wings, large wings held together by wax. They were going to use these wings to escape. The fateful day approached and they donned the wings, perching at the window. Daedulus warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sun, for the wax would melt and the wings would fall apart.</p>
  <p style="color:rgb(60, 50, 90)">Yet, however, icarus did not heed his uncle's warning, and flew high in his glee. The wax began to melt, but he did not care. The feathers began to fall to the ocean, but he did not mind. Too late Icarus realized what happened. He plunged into the sea where it is assumed he met his end.</p>
