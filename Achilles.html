<p>Achilles was born from a mortal father and the immortal Nereid morther. Fearful for his saftey, his mother took him to the River Styx on the surface and dipped him in, holding his heel.  Achilles becomes invunerable to all forms of physical attacks. As Achilles becomes a man, the Trojan War starts, and Achilles joins the fray. He kills many men in chariot duels, one specifically Hector, in where Achilles then tied Hector's body to his chariot axle and dragged it around the city walls.</p>
<p>Achilles wins many more battles, leading charges, and never gaining a wound. In one fateful battle, Achilles is shot in his heel, killing him immediately</p>
<p>The possible myth of Achilles would have been told to make sure the youth don't take too much pride in their strength, as everyone has a weak spot. This moral doesn't exaclty only target youth, but would also go to anyone, as anyone of age, race, background, or anything could take too much pride in their strength.</p>
 <ul>
     <li>Achilles thinks he's too good</li>
     <ul>
     <li>Surprise, it's hubris</li>
     </ul>
     <li>He thinks he's too good</li>
     <li>He dies anyway</li>
